  working with technology and telling stories. I focus on React.js, Next.js, and
  the MERN stack, and I&apos;m always looking to learn and grow in my skills. I enjoy
  building apps that can really help people.

  Besides coding, I have a passion for storytelling, especially in the fantasy genre. 
  I believe stories can take us to amazing places, and I love creating characters 
  and adventures that spark the imagination. Writing is a great way for me to share 
  my thoughts and feelings.
